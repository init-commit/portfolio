### How I am doing
<!-- How did you feel? -->
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was both exixiting and overwhelming because I got to meet my supervisors and was introduced to Angular. I have never coded in Angular before and the pressure of learning a new framework is on me so much but I have to learn and make myself peoductive.
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more excited because I am on a new chapter of my journey to being a competent Software Engineer.

- I find the project to be exciting and it challenges me because it's something new and I have to put in a lot of effort to be competitve and good enough for the project.

- My level of stress is manageable.
